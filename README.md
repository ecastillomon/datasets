Datasets of my own creation using public sources only


# NFL Stadium Location
Stadium locations contains coordinates for the stadium obtained by geocoding stadium names with Open Street Maps.
Stadiums keep their last name to date, and in case of demolished stadiums, a proxy for their location is used.

# NFL Games Temperature
Contains min, max temperature, and precipitation for each game played. Each stadium is assigned the observed measurements of that same day of the closest metereological point in the dataset:
